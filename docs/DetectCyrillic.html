<H2><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H2>
<P>This package permits to detect automatically all live Cyrillic codings -
<A HREF="#item_windows%2d1251">windows-1251</A>, <A HREF="#item_koi8%2dr">koi8-r</A>,
<A HREF="#item_koi8%2du">koi8-u</A>, <A HREF="#item_iso%2d8859%2d5">iso-8859-5</A>,
<A HREF="#item_utf%2d8">utf-8</A>, <A HREF="#item_cp866">cp866</A>,
<A HREF="#item_x%2dmac%2dcyrillic">x-mac-cyrillic</A>, as well
as the language - <STRONG>Russian</STRONG> or <STRONG>Ukrainian</STRONG>. It applies 3 algorithms for
detection:
<A HREF="#stage 1. formal analysis of alphabet hits and capitalization">formal analysis of alphabet hits</A>,
<A HREF="#stage 2. frequency analysis of words and 2letter combinations.">frequency analysis of words and frequency analysis of 2-letter combinations</A>.</P>
<P>It also provides routines for conversion between different codings of Cyrillic
texts which can be imported if necessary.</P>
<P>The package permits to detect coding with one or two words only. Certainly,
in case of one word reliability will be low, especially if you wrote the words
for testing completely in lower or uppercase, as capitalization is a very
important attribute for coding detection. Nethertheless the package correctly
recognizes coding in a message containing one single word, even all lowercase -
'privet' ('hello' in Russian), 'ivan', 'vodka', 'sputnik'. ;-)))</P>
<P>Ukrainian language will be specified only if the text contains specific
Ukrainian letters.</P>
<P>Performance is good as the analysis passes two stages: on the first
only formal and fast analysis of proper capitalization and alphabet hit
is carried out and only if these data are not enough, the input is analyzed
second time - on frequency dictionaries.</P>
<P>

<P><EM>MaxTokens</EM> - the package <EM>stops analyzing</EM> the input, if the given number
of Cyrillic tokens is reached. You have not to analyze all 100 or 200 thousand
bytes from the input if after first 100 tokens the coding and the language can
be easily determined. If not specified, this argument defaults to 100.</P>
<P><EM>DetectAllLang</EM> - by default the package assumes Russian language only. Setting
this parameter to any non-zero value will involve analysis on two languages -
Russian and Ukrainian. This slows down perfomance by nearly 10% and can in rare
cases may result in a worse coding detection.</P>

<H2><A NAME="how it works">HOW IT WORKS</A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="stage 1. formal analysis of alphabet hits and capitalization">Stage 1. Formal analysis of alphabet hits and capitalization</A></H3>
<P>Started programming, I came from an obvious fact: a 'human' reader can
easily determine the coding and language from one sight, or at least to say
<EM>the text to be displayed in a wrong coding</EM>. The thing is that the <EM>alphabets</EM>,
i.e. <EM>letters</EM> of most Cyrillic codings do <EM>not</EM> coincide so if we try to
display text in a bad coding we will <EM>inevitably</EM> see on screen messy characters
inside words which can not be typed with Russian or Ukrainian keyboard layout
in a standard way - valuta signs, punctuation marks, Serbian letters, sometimes
binary characters etc etc.</P>
<P>Indeed we have only one hard case: the two most popular Cyrillic codings -
windows-1251 and koi8-r - have their alphabets in the same range from 192 to 255,
but <EM>uppercase</EM> letters of windows-1251 are placed on the codes of <EM>lowercase</EM>
letters of koi8-r and vice versa, so 'Ivan Petrov' in one of these codings
will look like 'iVAN pETROV' in another, i.e. have absolutely <EM>wrong
capitalization</EM> which can be also easily determined by formal analysis of
characters. And as you may guess any more or less consistent Cyrillic text
must have at least one word starting with a capital letter (I don't take in
consideration some weird Internet inhabitants WRITING ALL WITH CAPITAL LETTERS ;-).</P>
Also on the first stage of analysis the program consequently assumes the given
text has been written in one of 6 or 7 Cyrillic codings and calculates:
<div style='position:relative;left:30'>
1. how many tokens have inside 'bad' characters which are not
part of the Russian or Ukrainian alphabet and cannot be typed with standard
keyboard layout; <br>
2. how many tokens have improper capitalization which differs
from normal <i>UPPERCASE</i>, <i>lowercase,</i> and <i>Proper</i> words capitalization.
</div><P>This formal analysis is very <EM>fast</EM> and suits for 99.9% of <EM>real</EM> texts.
Wrong codings are easily filtered out and we get only one 'absolute winner'.
This method is also reliable: I can hardly imagine a normal person writing in
reverse capitalization. But what if we have only a few words and all them are
in upper- or lowerscase?</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="stage 2. frequency analysis of words and 2letter combinations.">Stage 2. Frequency analysis of words and 2-letter combinations.</A></H3>
<P>In this case we apply frequency analysis of words and 2-letter combinations,
called also <EM>hashes</EM> (not in <EM>Perl</EM> sense, certainly ;-).</P>
<P>The package has dictionaries for 300 most frequent Russian and Ukrainian words
and for nearly 600 most frequent Russian and Ukrainian 2-letter combinations,
built by myown (the input texts were maybe not be very typical for Internet
authors but any linguist can assure you this is not very principal:
first hundreds of the most popular words in any language are very stable,
nothing to say about letter combinations).</P>
<P>Also the text is analyzed second time (this shouldn't take too much time as we may
get into situation like this only in case of a very short text); all the Cyrillic
letters analized, no matter in which capitalization they are. If we found at least
one word - the coding is determined on it, otherwise - on comparison of letter
hashes.</P>
<P>In some very rare cases (usually in a very artificial situation when we have
only one short word written all in lower- or uppercase) the statistics on several
codings are equal. In this case we prefer windows-1251 to mac, koi8-r to koi8-u
and - if nothing helps  - windows-1251 to koi8-r.</P>
<P>To judge about which algorithm was applied you may wish to analyze the 4th
variable, returned by the function <EM>Detect</EM> - <A HREF="#item_%24algorithm">$Algorithm</A>.

<P>The supported codings are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_windows%2D1251">windows-1251</A></STRONG><BR>

This is the most popular Cyrillic coding nowadays, used on nearly 99% PC's.
Full alphabet starts with code 192 (uppercase A), like most Microsoft character
sets for national languages, and ends with code 255 (lowercase ya). Contains
also characters for Ukrainian, Byelorussian and other languages based on
Cyrillic alphabet. Can be easily sorted etc.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_koi8%2Dr">koi8-r</A></STRONG><BR>

Transliterated coding; terrible remnant of the old 7-bit world.
First another coding - koi7-r was designed, where Russian characters were on
places of <STRONG>similar</STRONG> English ones, for example Russian A on place of English A,
Russian R (er) on place of English R etc. Even if there were no Cyrillic
fonts at all the text still stayed readable. <EM>Koi8-r</EM> is in essence the same
archeologic <EM>Koi7-r</EM> with characters shifted to the extended part of ASCII
table. <EM>Koi8-r</EM> is still used on Unix-based computers, therefore it is the
second popular Russian coding on the Net.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_koi8%2Du">koi8-u</A></STRONG><BR>

The same as koi8-r, but with Ukrainian characters added.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_utf%2D8">utf-8</A></STRONG><BR>

A good textual representation of Unicode text. Basic characters (codes &lt; 128)
are represented with one-byte codes, while all other languages except
Oriental ones - with two-byte sequences. See RFC 2279 'UTF-8, a transformation
format of ISO 10646' for detailed information.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_iso%2D8859%2D5">iso-8859-5</A></STRONG><BR>

Though this coding is approved by ISO, it is used only on some rare Unix systems,
for example on Russian Solaris. For my whole life on the Net I have met only one
or two guys working on computers like these.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_cp866">cp866</A></STRONG><BR>

Also called 'alternative' coding. Used under DOS and Russian OS/2.
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_x%2Dmac%2Dcyrillic">x-mac-cyrillic</A></STRONG><BR>

Macintosh coding. Lowercase letters almost completely coincide with Windows-1251
(except 2 characters) so in some rare cases <EM>x-mac-cyrillic</EM> can be confused with
<EM>windows-1251</EM>. On the Internet this coding has almost died out; its share
is absolutely insignificant. On PC platform it is supported by default only
under Windows NT+.
